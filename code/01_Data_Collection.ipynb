I thought it would be too juvenile for my taste. I was wrong, of course.I can honestly say that I loved every minute of this. It's a spectacular little romp with funny, courageous, and endearing characters that you can't help but love.It has talking chess pieces, singing hats, a giant three-headed dog named Fluffy, a hilarious giant with a dragon fetish, a master wizard that's just a little bit crazy, mail carrier owls, goblins running a bank, unicorns, centaurs(!), trolls . . . and probably much more that I'm forgetting. And then there's the lead characters: Hermione, the young scholar who starts out prim and up-tight but soon becomes a true friend; Ron, the boy who has little money but who has an abundance of family and loyalty to his friends to make up for it; and then there's Harry, the boy who starts out sleeping in a closet and ends up being a hero. Harry is kind to those that deserve it, fearless when it counts the most, and wonderfully intelligent. What's not to love? In regards to the ending: (view spoiler)[I feel silly saying this about a middle grade novel, but I didn't suspect Quirrell a bit! If there were hints that he was the true culprit and not Snape, I obviously missed them. (hide spoiler)]FAVORITE QUOTE: \"But from that moment on, Hermione Granger became their friend. There are some things you can't share without ending up liking each other, and knocking out a twelve-foot mountain troll is one of them.\"Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm off to start Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets.*******************************************************My reviews of other titles in this series:Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets\n",

Jackson in Pulp Fiction: It \"ain't the same fuckin' ballpark, it ain't the same league, it ain't even the same fuckin' sport.\" There was a day when I thought I needed to defend Harry Potter, in the midst of the now dead Twilight craze, and you can see that below in what was my original review. It is a testament to the power of this series, that while various other franchises (Twilight, Hunger Games) have surged into popularity and then faded, Harry Potter remains unwaveringly strong after nineteen years. It is clear readers hold just as much admiration for these books as they always have. Time has not dimmed that.I will, one day, write an essay about what these books mean to me. Eternal, this is the one that started it all. Original review (circa 2010) A note in regard to the on-going Potter vs Twilight debate: Go ahed, tell me Twilight is better. Tell me that James is scarier than Voldemort, That the Cullens are a better family than the Weasly's That Edward is cooler than Harry, and Bella is smarter than Hermione. Tell me that Stephenie Meyer is more talented than J.K. Rowling. Go ahead, I dare you. Those who think the topic of Harry Potter or Twilight is worth debating and arguing over, are utterly stupid. Quite frankly-this book is amazing. \n",

Ah, the effortless metabolism of youth.)One day, there were shiny new books on her school library's \"New Releases\" shelf. Harry Potter, books 1 through 3. She had heard of the books before, of course, since they were a constant presence on the NYT bestsellers list, but she had always avoided them, thinking of them as children's novels.At the grand age of 14, surely she was too old for a little kid's fantasy novel. She had read the Outlander series earlier that year, after all. And it had sex in it. SEX! She didn't really quite understand everything in the book, but the point is, she had read them. Surely, at 14, Khanh was ready for more mature novels.And that did not include Harry Potter. Harry Potter is 11. Khanh is 14. There is a vast difference in their ages. Khanh was a teenager, dammit.But the Harry Potter books were new. Brand new. They were shiny, they had never been touched by another reader. And Khanh was tempted.She picked up the first book in the series: Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone.The end.Or rather, the beginning.\n",

Right when I became legally old enough to work, I went in and submitted my application and a few weeks later I was selling literature to the masses.Why do I tell you this story on this review, you ask? Well, at the time, young adult/teen literature consisted mainly of RL Stein, Christopher Pike, Beverly Cleary, Judy Blume, and a few other classic Newberry Award winners, but certainly we did not have a YA section to the extent you see it today.Towards the end of my tenure at Waldenbooks - as Oprah's book club was hitting its stride and Men Are From Mars, Women Are From Venus was in its bazzilionth week on the New York Times best seller list - a book display arrived featuring a buzzy new title about a certain boy wizard. I remember the display at the front of the store, and selling a few copies, but I didn't realize what it would become.A few years later (early 2000s), I had kinda gotten out of the loop on what was big in books. I had just finished college, which had taken up most of my free reading time. A friend of mine named Bronco (yup, real name, not a nickname, who also was the Best Man at my wedding) had a copy of this book on his coffee table. Holy cow! Here is that same book we were selling at Waldenbooks about 5 years before - what was he doing with it!?Well, he said it was good, so I borrowed it. I quickly plowed through the first 4 books and then got the pleasure of joining the world in waiting for the release of Order of the Phoenix. And, I noticed when I went to the bookstore, the YA section and selection was not so small anymore. I truly believe it was Harry Potter that opened the door to get more young adults (and even adults, of course) reading and authors interested in writing for that genre.\n",

But, seriously, not many books have such a well-developed system. We have different categories, spell names, potions and books, lots of books on magic. And who doesn’t like books on magic?

      "On my list of reasons why my daughters are the bestest thing to ever happen to me, Number 14,577 is that they gave me, at 41 years old, the perfect excuse to revisit the Harry Potter series. When my oldest angel told me she wanted to start reading the Harry Potter books, I couldn’t have been happier. As I was collecting all seven volumes off the shelf to bring up to her room, I started feeling nostalgic for the whole Hogwarts gang, and I realized that I’d never done more than a perfunctory review of this first volume. I figured it was high time to rectify that oversight.Harry deserves it. However, with over a million ratings, and almost two reviews for every day I’ve been alive, I think I can dispense with any plot distillation or character profiles. It has all been eloquently said before. Therefore, I just want to briefly express what I see as the essential magic at the heart of the series, and why I think it has resonated so strongly with so many people. Here goes...Only rarely does a story come along that can so completely wrap you up in a warm blanket of contentment and good feelings. One that can hold at bay, even if only for precious moments, the nasty brutishness of what often passes for daily life. These stories do that. It’s an escape into a world of optimism, honor, and hope, where things always look hopeful and anything is possible. Who wouldn't want to hang around in a place like that, especially when it is decorated with sorting hats, kindly giants, magic wands and Quidditch.Granted...no aspect of the story is revolutionary, or even particularly noteworthy, from the standpoint of blazing new trails within the fantasy genre. It isn’t great literature, and nothing about its technical merits makes it befitting of even a fraction of its unprecedented success. Fine...acknowledged. And? So what!The virtue of this story is the postive feelings it conjures in its readers. Harry’s story is something that radiates acceptance, inclusion, and friendship. It invokes a sense of belonging. Inside these pages, you can find the impetus to see the better angels of humanity’s nature, and feel just a little better about the world around you.How is that not worthy of praise?As for Harry himself, he’s just a good kid. The quintessential everyman who makes good. A loving boy with a clear head on his shoulders and a caring heart that pumps affection for the world around him. He’s someone you can’t help but like. He’s not perfect. He makes mistakes, he’s occasionally short sighted, and I know many of us wish he would stick up for himself a little more. Maybe reduce his aunt and uncle to a pair of fatty stains on the carpet, or give Dudley an atomic wedgie until his skivvies scrape against his pancreas. But that’s not Harry. He’s a better person than that. That’s why we love him. Maybe all of the above is a bit much. Like I said, I was feeling nostalgic and maybe the gush got a tad away from me. Let’s just say that these stories are perfect comfort food and reading them will make you happy. I’ll certainly settle for that. As for the rating, I Initially only gave this first volume 3 stars, and I’m not going to change that now. As much as I love the series as a whole, I don’t think it reaches stratospheric heights until Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire. Still, this is where it all began. As such, it should be read and savored knowing that it only gets better.3.0 stars. Highly Recommended. \n",

Rowling catapults the reader into a fantasy world, populated by wizards and flying broomsticks, unicorns and talking hats. A world where even the most complicated topics, such as the death, are treated with delicate gentleness. «After all, to the well-organized mind, death is but the next great adventure» words of Albus Dumbledore, the master of life and the most charismatic character of the universe created by Rowling. An universe where your worst misfortune is to be a non-magical, a sad \"muggle\" who will never be able to see the platform nine and three quarters.Let me dream.Vote: 10Lasciatemi sognare.Mentre leggo per la prima volta a mia figlia (6 anni) questo volume, personalmente (37 anni) sono alla terza rilettura di \"Harry Potter e la Pietra Filosofale\". Tutti dovrebbero leggere questo libro, quantomeno per rendersi conto del perché si sia diffuso il fenomeno \"Harry Potter\". Con uno stile godibilissimo ed essenziale J.K. Rowling catapulta il lettore in un mondo fantastico, popolato da maghi e scope volanti, unicorni e cappelli parlanti. Un mondo dove perfino i temi più complicati come la morte vengono trattati con delicata leggerezza. «In fin dei conti, per una mente ben organizzata, la morte non è che una nuova, grande avventura» ci dice Silente, il maestro di vita, la figura più carismatica dell'universo creato dalla Rowling. Un universo dove la sfortuna più grande è quella di essere un non magico, un triste \"babbano\" che non sarà mai in grado di vedere il binario nove e tre quarti.Lasciatemi sognare.Voto: 10\n",

      "Re-Read 2017MY BLOG: Melissa Martin's Reading ListI'M GOING TO ADD MY BIG OLE SPOILER THING FOR THOSE THAT HAVEN'T READ THESE BOOKS YET. I'M ALSO GOING TO ADD A FEW PICTURES THAT ARE IN THE BOOK SO YOU CAN SEE HOW BEAUTIFUL IT IS AND RUN OUT AND BUY IT, IF YOU HAVEN'T ALREADY!LET US BEGIN!Poor Harry's parents were killed by VOLDEMORT! Yep, I said it :-) So Dumbledore (the head honcho) and the gang decide to leave Harry with his mother's sister, Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon and their brat of a son, Dudley. This was a huge mistake because they were so mean to him growing up. He had to live in a cupboard under the stairs and wear Dudley's hand-me-downs. They didn't get him gifts or do anything nice for him. :-( They didn't even tell him what really happened to his parents, what they were and what he was... until one day.. on his eleventh birthday he started getting all of these letters in the mail inviting him to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. But his stupid family tried to keep the letters from Harry, this didn't go over well and we get to meet sweet, wonderful Hagrid. :-)Hagrid is stunned that Harry doesn't know anything about anything and begins to fill him in, he also brings him a cake for his bday :-)Moving on.. so Harry finds out about all the things he needs to find out about and Hagrid carts him off to the bank to get all of this money his parents left for him so he can buy supplies for school! I just loved in the movies and the books when they went shopping at Diagon Alley. I want to go there! After Harry gets to school he gets into Gryffindor with his new friends, Ron, Hermione (my heroine), all of the Weasley's, and Neville. There are a lot of sweet people in their house. He has an arch nemesis named Malfoy that get into Slytherin, the house Voldemort was in at one time. Soooooo.... I'm not going to tell every little thing about the book as most have read it and some that haven't just might take a little peek :-) Let's sum this up to say that Harry gets on the Quidditch team (read to find out what that is), there are trolls with nasty snot, a secret the group are trying to figure out, great times spent with Hagrid, many magical moments and an appearance of sorts by someone that will not be named......I'm going to leave you with some pictures from the book, I had no idea that Jim Kay who is the illustrator is the same man who illustrated, \"A Monster Calls,\" by Patrick Ness and he also has a rescued greyhound like me :-) Yay! ...OH and there will be no captions to the pictures, you can figure out most yourself or just look at the pretty pictures, just know that there are many more pictures in the book and all of the pages have something cool on them! I highly recommend this edition of the book!I will say again to go out and buy this illustrated edition, it's so wonderful and I can't wait to get the rest of them in the illustrated editions!!!!!!!! Like yesterday!!!!!! Kudos to J.K. Rowling for writing the series and to Jim Kay for his wonderful illustrations! Professor McGonagall approves :-)I LOVED TAKING THIS TRIP BACK DOWN MEMORY LANE WITH THE GROUP AND THE MAGIC!\n",

I don't think anything I write here hasn't been said already. But I've just read the illustrated edition by Jim Kay and if it is possible, it makes this book even more outstanding than it already is. Jim Kay is awesome. Maybe you have read  A Monster Calls  and already know him. If not, you should definitley reconsider your life choices.I am certainly going to buy an edition of this, it's so pretty I could die. Looking forward to the illustrated sequels!1000/5 stars.Find more of my books on Instagram\n",
