# Young Adult - Book Recommender System

## Problem Statement

Develop a young adult book recommender system for consumers, film studios and publishing companies. 

**Consumers**: A common struggle amongst readers is finding the next book to read. The recommender system will allow them to easily explore potential book options based on a previous book they've liked.

**Film Studios**: Young adult fiction is a popular genre for movie adaptations, but not all perform well in the box office. One contributing factor is the storyline. By using the recommender system, executives can search for books that have had successful adaptations and find similar books to make into a film. Choosing a book that shares the same, large reading fanbase as an existing movie adaptation will increase the chances of it receiving a positive reception.

**Publishing Companies**: Publishing companies can leverage the recommender system in a similar way. By searching for a successful book and those similar to it, decision-makers can determine commonalities among them. These will be important features to consider and look for when deciding on a publication.  

The recommendation system will be based on a book's metadata (title, author, page count) and individual user ratings. This information will be acquired through [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/), a social cataloging website that contains a large book database.
